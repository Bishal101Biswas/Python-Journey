    1. Integers
    2. Floating Point (a.k.a. Decimal)

print("If you want to know which type of number youre dealing with then there's an easy way to find out about that.\nJust type \'type()\' inside your code editor or IDE and then enter the number inside the brackets. Your python \ninterpreter will tell you which type of number youre dealing with.\n\n\t\te.g.\n\n\t\t\t$ type(-19374.55)\n\nwill give you an answer something like this\n\n\t\t\t", type(-19374.55))

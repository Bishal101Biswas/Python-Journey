''' In Python you can use Mathematical operators i.e. +, -, *, /, even some more operators like (%) this one as well.
    
    Below we'll discuss what some of those new operators do in and how are they used inside Python'''

print("+ is also used in Concatenation i.e. adding some variables to an existing string using +")
